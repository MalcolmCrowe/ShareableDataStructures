Be aware that the Tpcc program attempts to access a database called Tpcc,
which by default will be in the same folder as StrongDB.exe.
This can be confusing if you hide file extensions. I recommend
copying the binaries to different folders to avoid this confusion.
All the executables expect to find copies of the dlls in their folder.
