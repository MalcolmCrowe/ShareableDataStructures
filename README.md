# ShareableDataStructures
I am developing a set of general-purpose shareable data structures for C# and Java all of whose fields are public readonly/final, and use Bookmarks instead of Iterators.
The files are in the subfolders: Shareable for C# and ShareableJ for Java. The C# version uses C# 8.0 (beta), as in the Preview of Visual Studio 2019.
