#ShareableDataStructures #StrongDBMS
I am developing a set of general-purpose shareable data structures for C# and Java all of whose fields are public readonly/final, and use Bookmarks instead of Iterators.
The basic library is in the folders Shareable for C# and ShareableJ for Java. The C# version uses C# 8.0, and this option need to be selected in Visual Studio 2019. The Java version is JDK 11. 
Various versions of the Tpcc Windows Forms application for different DBMS are included here. In all cases Visual Studio will only recompile if you right click on the project node in Solution Explorer and select Rebuild.
