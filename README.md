#ShareableDataStructures #StrongDBMS
I am developing a set of general-purpose shareable data structures for C# and Java all of whose fields are public readonly/final, and use Bookmarks instead of Iterators.
The files are in the subfolders for versions 0.0 and 0.1: Shareable for C# and ShareableJ for Java. The C# version uses C# 8.0 (beta), as in the Preview of Visual Studio 2019. The Java version is JDK 11.
