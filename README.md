# ShareableDataStructures
I am developing a set of general-purpose shareable data structures for C# and Java all of whose fields are public readonly/final, and use Bookmarks instead of Iterators.
The updated files are in the subfolders: Shareable for C# and ShareableJ for Java.

27 Oct: Transactions redesigned and now shareable. I will do the Java classes next and then test everything.
