# ShareableDataStructures
I am developing a set of general-purpose shareable data structures for C# and Java all of whose fields are public readonly/final, and use Bookmarks instead of Iterators.
The updated files are in the subfolders: Shareable for C# and ShareableJ for Java.

25 Oct: Transaction.cs needs more work: can't be a subclass of SDatabase, should become shareable.
