create table b(a int primary key, c int)
insert into b values(5,2),(6,1),(7,4)
create table d(e int array)
insert into d values(array(select c from b g))
select e[0] from d

6.1 doesn't allow the table d verification
6.2 OSPSvr crashes if its in a transaction while computing _ETag if table b is not committed
and fails on select e[0] from d if table d is not committed
6.2 EmbeddedOSP is confused as to the datatype being transmitted
e[0] left is SqlName

Try order by with different options
Try goup and having

with table a(b int,c int)
select * from a
select b from a
select b as d from a
select a.b from a
select a.b as b from a
select a.b from a d
select d.b from a d
select d.b as e from a d
select d.b as c from a d
select c.b from a c
select * from a d
select (b) from a
select (a.b) from a
select (d.b) as c from a
select (b,c) from a
select (b,a.c) from a
select (b as d,c) from a
select (b,d.c) from a d
select b+1 from a
select b from a order by c
select b from a order by b+c
select a.b+1 from a
select c.b+1 as d from a c 
select b from a order by b

Repeat all the above with primary key
